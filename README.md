# Mapbox Workshop

## Using Turf.js
Turf.js is an open source JavaScript library for advanced geospatial analysis. In the examples folder, you'll see a couple of examples that use Turf.js with Mapbox GL JS to display and analyze data.
- [Turf.js documentation](http://turfjs.org/)
- [Turf.js source code](https://github.com/Turfjs/turf)

## Dealing with data
GIS is roughly 90% data cleaning and 10% mapping. Check out the data folder of this repo for more information about common data issues and example datasets.

## Programmatically working with Mapbox
If you're familiar with Python, I recommend checking out Mapbox's python CLI: https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-cli-py.

The Mapbox web services APIs allow for programmatic access to Mapbox tools and services. Use these APIs to retrieve information about your account, upload and change resources, and use core Mapbox tools. To get started, check out the documentation:
- [Maps Services APIs](https://www.mapbox.com/api-documentation/#maps)
- [Geocoding API](https://www.mapbox.com/api-documentation/#geocoding)
- [Directions API](https://www.mapbox.com/api-documentation/#directions)
